# Things Switchboard Needs
The little stuff, ya know?

## ALL CAPS POST TITLES ARE SCARY
* Write a function that uses a `RegExp` to detect strings that consist of all caps. 
* Hook this regex up to an `<input/>` form element to see if what the user is typing is in ALL CAPS.
* Output a message above the form element
* Wrap this all in a function that takes some options.

I.e., I would like to be able to tell the function which form element to inspect and where to output the warning message.
