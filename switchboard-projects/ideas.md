# Things Switchboard Needs
The little stuff, ya know?

## ALL CAPS POST TITLES ARE SCARY
* Write a function that uses a `RegExp` to detect strings that consist of all caps. 
* Hook this regex up to an `<input/>` form element to see if what the user is typing is in ALL CAPS.
* Output a message above the form element
* Wrap this all in a function that takes some options.

I.e., I would like to be able to tell the function which form element to inspect and where to output the warning message.

## CHILLIN' @ MY REG EXP
**Please read Chapter 9 of Eloquen JS before attempting**
* Write a regular expression for detecting whether a user is "@mentioning" in a textarea. There are some special cases to consier:
  - "@ " should not trigger a "mentioning" state
  - We must be able to detect first and last name combinations.
  - There are more edge cases, but I'll let you find those on your own!
