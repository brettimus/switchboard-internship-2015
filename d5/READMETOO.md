# Week of July 6
This weekâ€™s project is tiny, 
but I encourage you can take in any direction that will help you learn.

It is _drumroll_ An interactive chart!

# What you gotta do (a.k.a. the bear necessities)

1. Find some data.

If you want, I'll supply you with the jukebox data I've been talking about nonstop.

2. Create an interactive, explanatory chart from ur d8a.

This means you should explore the data first. 
Find some cool (interactive) properties of the data, 
and incorporate them into a chart that has several possible states. 

(I.e., your chart should respond to user input in some fashion.)


3. Wrap all of this up in a simple web page.

There are several design considerations here.
* zee basics (font, color, positioning)
* hierarchy of your exposition and instructions
* how should users be able interact with your chart
* bells and whistles, like should the user be able to save the chart, etc.

# If you want more concrete suggestions

Make a chart that allows you to explore time series data

- Select / search from a list of things
- Look at given thing's frequency over time
- distribution of things on a given day (stacked) across time


# If you get bored

Try making a graph-based chart (graph as in like a graph-structure, not graphical lolz).

This will definitely involve processing data. Try to do this processing as elegantly as possible. You'll learn stuff. It'll be :tada:
