# The Next Two-Three Weeks
The new dashboard is moving along very quickly, so I figured I would go ahead and revise our plan for the next few weeks.

# 6/15
D3 learning times. Ask me questions as you practice d3, and we’ll have extended 1:1s on Weds.

Throughout the week I’ll get a roadmap started. Don’t worry about it for now, but if you get bored during your personal week, you are free to tackle things on the roadmap.

There will be several things that need to be either improved upon or written from scratch. I’ll detail them to the best of my ability and leave them in this repo.

# 6/22
This is your week. Enjoy!

# 6/29
Start work on d5. You should both already have commit privs.

I’ll have a live version of the new dashboard up. Your task will be to, as faithfully as possible, clone / improve upon the charts and graphs used in Gnargus.

Our aim will be to eventually separate out all (base) charting code from Gnargus and pass off the heavy lifting to d5.

So, either this week (the week of the 29th) or the next, I’ll set you both up with a Switchboard development environment. This will probably take a full day, but it will make testing and stuff a lot better.
