# Switchboard Internship MegaJam 2K15 Summer Time Yeah Buddy
## Synopsis

In general, you will work for Switchboard 3 days per week (the exception being from weeks 1-4). 
Starting around Week 6, you will be writing code alongside Boots for the front-end component of Switchboard's client-facing reporting tool.

It is our hope that by the end of the internship, you will have a solid portfolio, code on our production servers, and the palms of your hands will be shockingly sore (from all the high-fives we'll be giving each other, amirite?!).

## The Gist

Your 2 free-days are for you to work on whatever. 
In the beginning, I'll ask that you come to the office on these days, but we can re-evaluate that as time goes on. 

On your 3 not-free-days, we will be working in JavaScript Land. Yeahhhh buddy!

Because a lot of what youâ€™ll be doing with Switchboard focuses on the engineering/development side of writing code, I would like to offer help in tackling more computer-sciency projects on your free days. 

Such projects could include things like implementing the y-combinator, writing your own programming language, or looking at any fun-seeming topic of your choosing.

Towards the end of the internship, I'll try to bring in people to give fun talks.
Tell me things you're interested in, 
and I'll try to find people who will talk at our faces about said interesting-to-you stuff.


## What You'll Learn

Here is a list of the technologies/skills that we'll dive into:
    * Javascript and [node](https://nodejs.org/)
    * HTML/CSS/SVG (basics)
    * Git (basics)
    * Managing projects on GitHub
    * Data visualization in [d3](http://d3js.org/).
    * Automating build tasks with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
    * Generating documentation from comments with [jsdoc](https://usejsdoc.org).
    * Writing unit tests with [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit).
    * Publishing your work to package managers like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/).


## Resources
_Expect this section to grow in the coming weeks_

We will work out of the book [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) for the first three weeks. There are two copies for you two at the office, but the contents of the book are also available online for free (see the link above) :tada: :money_with_wings:.

For your personal projects, I have a lot of ideas. I'll keep my copy of [The New Turing Omnibus](http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Turing-Omnibus-Excursions/dp/0805071660) at my desk if you want to get nerdy. If you're so inclined, you should pick up your own copy.

## Timeline
This is all very, very tentative.
### Week 1 - 2
You'll work 5 days/week out of the book eloquentjs. 
As you progress, I'll start integrating additional work into your exercises 
in order to introduce you to some of the tools we'll be using 

### Week 3
We'll spend 4 days of the week learning D3.

### Week 4
This is your week! You have the full week to work on whatever projects you so desire.

Might I suggest you begin by setting up a personal website (i.e., your portfolio) through GitHub pages?

### Week 5
We'll look into how to build reusable d3 code.

### Week 6
We'll sketch out what we want the new reporting tool to look like.

### Week 7 - 8
We'll write charts for the new reporting tool and start pushing code.

### Weeks BEYOND
Who knows.


## Things you should have installed

* First and foremost, install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if you're on a Mac.
* You need `git` (run `$ brew update && brew install git`)
* An account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
* A solid text editor. I use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), and it is great.
* `npm` (run `$ brew update && brew install npm`). This should also install `node`.

We can install other tools as the need arises (once you have `npm` it's super easy), but these should be good enough to get us going in the beginning!
