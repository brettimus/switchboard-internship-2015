## Create a Package Manager
That is, look up what a package manager "is"

## Game of Faded Life
Make a game of life simulation that runs for N turns,
(silently) caches the lifespans of cells throughout those N turns,
and animates a game of life 
where cells fade into and out of existence according to their lifespans.
