# A Quiz of Sorts
[This one is a doozy.](http://perfectionkills.com/javascript-quiz/)

## Note
The author assumes ES3, not ES5 (which is what node + your browser use).

Hence, some of the answers are actually different than expected (looking at you, number 9)...

I scored a 6 on my first pass. Shit's hard.
