# GitHub Pages and You
GitHub allows you to host static sites for free. This is ideal for personal web pages (or blogs). Down the line, you will be able to set a custom domain for your pages. http://me.me :tada:


[To get started, let's go here.](https://pages.github.com/) This should 


Once you have your site setup, we’ll push some content. Then, if you want, I have a little bit of designy stuff to work on whenever you tire of learning JS.  


## What you should do
* Choose a font from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts), and I’ll show you how to add it to your page.
* Choose a background and font color. You’re free to use a tool like [coolors](http://coolors.co/) or [kuler](https://color.adobe.com/).
* If you desire, peruse some of the readings (+games!) I’ve attached below on web design. As I said above, you’re free to use work time to read these if learning JS is boring right now.

## Typography is a Thing
It cannot be understated how critical typographic considerations are to good design. In fact…

[Study Shows: Web Design is Composed of ~95% Typography.](https://ia.net/know-how/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period)

This article is a classic (9 years is _old_ in internet time). If you want to talk about it, let me know and I’ll reread it.

What’s funny is I am writing this document in the IA writer app…

### A Game Appeared!
[The joy of kerning…](https://xkcd.com/1015/)

In typography, `tracking` refers to the general standard space between letters of a typeface, and `kerning` refers to special case where two _specific letters_ need a “custom” spacing to look aesthetically pleasing.

[Practice your kerning skills here.](http://type.method.ac/)

## Visual Hierarchy
Possibly the most important (and suitably abstract) characteristic of a design is its [visual hierarchy.](http://52weeksofux.com/post/443828775/visual-hierarchy)

This refers to the way a design elevates certain pieces of information above others. (E.g., the terms of service are never in large, bold font, right?)

The ability to speak in terms of visual hierarchy provides a very useful tool for critiquing designs. It is also a good starting point for new projects. 

The question “what is the foremost idea I want to convey to the user” leads naturally into a consideration of hierarchy.


## Color
If you want to do more with color, I can send your some _long_ articles. Color is really fascinating to me, and I want to spend some time in the next year creating a color generator. 

[Without ado, another game! Yay!](http://color.method.ac/)

## Misc
[Teset your ability to estimate pixel sizes.](http://pixact.ly/)

[method.ac](http://method.ac) has a few other design games.

The Bezier curves game is good if you want to understand (visually) what’s happening in a Bezier curve.

Also, [this is the wikipedia entry on Bezier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve).

You’re also free to use my _SVG Essentials_ book to read about them.
