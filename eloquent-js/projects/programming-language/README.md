# Egg
A simple programming language.

## Rules
* Everything is an expression.
* An expression is `Word` (variable), `Value` (number, string), or `Application`.
* An `Application` is used for function calls or evaluating blocks of control structures (e.g., `if`, `while`...)
* `do` is analogous to a block. Lets us do multiple things in sequence.
* `,` separates lines
* We ignore whitespace

## TODO
* Finish documentations
* Write examples in docs
* Write test suite
