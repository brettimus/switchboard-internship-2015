# Overview

These notes build off of material in the chapters. 
The format is simple, stupid (`FISS`).

Each has an overview and goes through some stupid, pedantic minutiae that I think were _glossed over_.
Some notes even end with a **:pizza: Food For Thought :pizza:** section, 
which serves as home to the random thought bubbles that hovered over my head while reading.

Of course, **Food For Thought** is optional.
