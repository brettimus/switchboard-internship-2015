# Overview

These notes build off of material in the chapters. 
The format is simple, stupid (`FISS`).

Each has an overview and goes through some stupid, pedantic minutiae that I think were _glossed over_.
Some notes even end with a **:pizza: Food For Thought :pizza:** section, 
which serves as home to the random thought bubbles that hovered over my head while reading.

Of course, **Food For Thought** is optional.

# GitHub Flavored Markdown
I may ask you to make a pull request on this repo to add tidbits as you see fit.

These documents are written in GitHub-Flavored-Markdown (GFM).
I could tell you I chose GFM because of GFM's wonderful syntax-highlighting support for multiple languages, 
but that would be a lie.

The true beauty of GFM? Emoji.
