So, all values in JavaScript behave like objects, and all objects are passed _by reference_ (as opposed to being passed _by value_).

> If you are unfamiliar with the difference between passing by reference and passing by value, consider a silly example of telling a friend your address. Passing your house by reference would mean that you tell your friend "my address is 12345 Main St.". Passing your house by value would imply that you told your friend "one sec, K?", then proceeded to make a to-scale replica of your domicile and physically moved it to where your friend was.
