# :construction: d3 projects
_This document will be filled out once we start working on d3 (around Week 3)_

## Format
On June 14th, 
we'll each come to work with 10 different visualizations 
that we think might be helpful in our prospective library
(bearing in mind the type of information our clients like to see).

Be prepared to defend your selections.

## Parameters
We'll remain open to any visualization, 
but while coming up with ideas, 
it'd be nice to consider what we would like to be able to show the following:

* (Possibly comparative) Growth of key metrics over _time_
* Counts and frequencies (over a certain timeframe)
* Meaning (that is, Good || Bad ? , etc)
* Comparisons across categories
* Annotations. Plz.

Furthermore, it'd be nice to reuse these charts in reports to users. 
Can you think of visualizations of user data?
